# MyReads Project

This is a simple book tracking app that allows a user to place books in any of the 3 book shelves listed below

    - Currently Reading
    - Want to read
    - Read
 
 The user can also search for books and add them to any of the shelves above.

## Installation

To get started the right way

* Clone this repository  `https://github.com/ringnyu/udacity-react-myreads.git`
* Change to the project's directory  `cd udacity-react-myreads`
* Now use npm to install all project dependencies `npm install`

## Usage

* Start the development server with `npm start`
* Once the server is started, the project can be viewed at  `https://localhost:3000`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
